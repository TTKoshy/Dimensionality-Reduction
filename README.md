Comparing Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: t-SNE and PCA on (sklearn) Digits Dataset

t-SNE and PCA are among the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction.

t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique. It works by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two probability distributions: one representing pairwise similarities of data points in the high-dimensional space and the other representing similarities in the low-dimensional space.
Since the optimization process depends on the initialization, it is recommended to run t-SNE multiple times with different initializations to identify the embedding that minimizes the KL divergence.

In contrast, PCA is a linear method that is computationally efficient and effective for detecting outliers and patterns in data. 
Performing PCA before t-SNE is often recommended, as it provides a useful initial understanding of the dataset and may improve the performance of t-SNE.

t-SNE is computationally intensive and may take several hours to process datasets with millions of samples, whereas PCA can complete the same task within seconds or minutes. 
Despite being slower than PCA, t-SNE often delivers better results for clustering.
